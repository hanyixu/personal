        <p>Advertising Undergraduate<br>Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse University</p>
        <div class="personal1"><p>I am a junior at Syracuse University Newhouse School of Public Communications,
            majoring in
            Advertising and minoring in Computer Engineering. While focusing learning real-world advertising skills, I
            am
            very
            interested in data
            analyzing and software development.</p></div>

        <h2>Things to say...</h2>
        <div><p>Advertising is an art, not only in
            production and publicity, but more in researching product personality, researching consumer needs,
            formulating and
            implementing creative strategies. Advertising involves various skills such as ethnography, quantitative
            research,
            and data analysis, rather than just designing a pretty poster. Studying advertising at Newhouse at Syracuse
            University has given me data collection and processing skills, as well as an understanding of world dynamics
            and the
            humanities of different places. I got a chance to see the world from a different perspective.</p></div>

            <h2>More about me</h2>
            <p>Besides that, I am also a photography enthusiast. I like to visit the wilderness in my free time for
                outdoor
                photography and aerial photography, and I also like to use specific lenses for portrait photography. You
                can see
                some of my photography on this website.</p>
            <p>I am from Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China, where I grew up. Ningbo is a very beautiful southern
                city in
                China. After
                graduating from high school, I went to the United States to pursue a bachelor's degree.</p>
