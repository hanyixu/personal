<div class="personal"><p>I am a junior at Syracuse University Newhouse School of Public Communications, majoring in
    Advertising and minoring
    in Computer Engineering. While focusing learning real-world advertising skills, I am very interested in data
    analyzing and software development.</p></div>

<div class="personal"><p>Advertising is an art, not only in
    production and publicity, but more in researching product personality, researching consumer needs, formulating and
    implementing creative strategies. Dynamic. Resilient. Adaptable. Advertising doesnâ€™t just survive in a shifting
    media climate;</p></div>

    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>Besides that, I am also a photography enthusiast. I like to visit the wilderness in my free time for outdoor
        photography and aerial photography, and I also like to use specific lenses for portrait photography. You can see
        some of my photography on this website.</p>
    <p>I am from Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China, where I grew up. Ningbo is a very beautiful southern city in China. After
        graduating from high school, I went to the United States to pursue a bachelor's degree.</p>
