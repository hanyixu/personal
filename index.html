        <p>Advertising Undergraduate<br>Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse University</p>
        <div class="personal1"><p>I am a junior at Syracuse University Newhouse School of Public Communications,
            majoring in Advertising and minoring in Computer Engineering. While focusing learning real-world advertising
            skills, I am very interested in data analyzing and front-end (website) development.</p></div>

        <h2>Things to say...</h2>
        <div><p>
            I chose a career in advertising because I enjoy the combination of social science and math. I find the
            research and analysis involved in advertising fascinating, and I love uncovering insights into consumer
            behavior. Understanding how people think and what drives their decisions is an important aspect of
            advertising, and it's a challenge that I enjoy taking on. I also appreciate the power of storytelling in
            public communications and the ability to create impactful productions that resonate with audiences. For me,
            advertising is a dynamic and exciting field that combines my passions for research, analysis, and creative
            storytelling.<br> <br>


            Studying advertising at Newhouse, Syracuse University was transformative for me. It developed my data
            skills, broadened my perspective, and developed my leadership. As a student, I took on leadership roles,
            developed team skills and became culturally competent. Studying at Newhouse gave me the tools to succeed in
            the industry and as a person.</p></div>

            <h2>More about me</h2>
            <p>Besides that, I am also a photography enthusiast. I like to visit the wilderness in my free time for
                outdoor photography and aerial photography, and I also like to use specific lenses for portrait
                photography. You
                can see some of my photographies on this website.</p>
            <p>I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo" target="_blank">Ningbo City</a>, Zhejiang
                Province, China. Ningbo is a very beautiful southern
                city in China. After graduating from high school, I went to the United States to pursue a bachelor's
                degree.</p>
