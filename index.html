    <div class="personal1"><p>I am a junior at Syracuse University Newhouse School of Public Communications, majoring in
        Advertising and minoring in Computer Engineering. While focusing learning real-world advertising skills, I am very
        interested in data
        analyzing and software development.</p></div>
</div>




<div class="personal2"><p>Advertising is an art, not only in
    production and publicity, but more in researching product personality, researching consumer needs, formulating and
    implementing creative strategies. Advertising involves various skills such as ethnography, quantitative research,
    and data analysis, rather than just designing a pretty poster. Studying advertising at Newhouse at Syracuse
    University has given me data collection and processing skills, as well as an understanding of world dynamics and the
    humanities of different places. I got a chance to see the world from a different perspective.</p></div>

    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>Besides that, I am also a photography enthusiast. I like to visit the wilderness in my free time for outdoor
        photography and aerial photography, and I also like to use specific lenses for portrait photography. You can see
        some of my photography on this website.</p>
    <p>I am from Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China, where I grew up. Ningbo is a very beautiful southern city in
        China. After
        graduating from high school, I went to the United States to pursue a bachelor's degree.</p>
