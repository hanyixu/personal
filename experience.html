            <li>The research is about understanding high-school students' attitudes toward being a teacher. Before
                field research, we learned qualitative research technics and research ethics.
            <li>We visited the local high school. We interviewed a class of students about why they wanted to become a teacher and
                what persuaded them to be a teacher. We held a focus group and collected these students' responses and opinions. We collect the data with the camera and then analyze the data together in the meeting
                and extract the keywords.

        <ul>
            <li>After high school, students look forward to their future courses. They are curious about college but
                also a little apprehensive. Therefore, Syracuse University offers the FYS 101 course, which aims to
                guide first-year students to learn the "rules of survival" of the university and teach them how to
                smoothly
                transition from high school to university to help them in their lives. As an FYS 101 peer leader, our
                task is to guide students to discuss and think in the FYS 101 class, answer students' questions (in
                class or by email), and help students understand the city of Syracuse and the culture of their
                ancestors.
            <li>After class, I also support the leading instructor in preparing courses, collecting student data and
                surveys, and replying to emails.
